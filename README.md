The classic game of Go, implemented in React.  The backend is built using C# and hosted on Azure.  Create an account and play against other humans, or if you don't have time for that, play offline against the (kinda basic) ai.  There are modes for a flat (standard) board or if you prefer something original, select "hexasphere" to play in 3D.
